- 3.3. Main menu: the "Information" item is not a link to the main page.
- 3.4. Main menu: four cells of the same width. For the first two items, alignment of the text to the left, for the last two - to the right.
- 3.5. Links in the main menu: only text should be clickable.

- 3.8. The Academy logo in the basement leads to the intensive landing page “HTML and CSS. Professional site layout ".

- 3.11. The button "Find a hotel in Sedona" controls the display of the hotel search form. Layout of the block with the hotel search form is required.
- 3.12. The calendar icon in the date input field should be added as a separate element so that in the future the programmer can hang a click event on it to open a calendar with a date selection option.
